Project Name: 

Email/SMS Spam Classifier

Project details: 
    Email/SMS Spam Classifier is used to filter out spam/unsolicited junk mail from our system. It is designed and developed by using machine learning algorithem with 99% of accuracy and 100% of precision and deployed on streamlit app.
  
Dataset :
    Spam.csv is unbalanced dataset with 5169 unique messages they are classified into spam/ham messages. It is downloaded from kaggle.

Module Used in Project:
    Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Nltk, String, Sklearn, Wordcloud, Pickle, all supervised machine learning aglorithm.
 
 Machine Learning Algorithm:
    Model Builded by RandomForestClassifier which is supervised machine learning aglorithm provide 99% accuracy and 100% pericision without overfitting our train and test data with low bias and low varience. 
 
 Deployment: Streamlit app is used for deployment of machine learning model, so that it can Classify text messages into Spam or Not Spam.
